# 🛡️ SOC Analyst Portfolio — Malavika Aswin

Welcome to my Security Operations (SOC) Analyst portfolio.  
This repository documents my learning journey, hands-on investigations, threat analysis work, and incident response exercises.  
I am building strong blue-team capabilities through continuous lab practice, platform-based cyber ranges, and structured SOC workflows.

## 👩‍💻 About Me

I am an aspiring SOC Analyst with a strong academic foundation in cyber security and growing hands-on experience in security monitoring, alert investigation, threat intelligence, and incident response.

I am currently developing practical skills in:

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- Host & network forensics
- Threat intelligence and IOC enrichment
- Suspicious activity triage and reporting
- Vulnerability scanning & baseline hardening

> My goal is to become an effective Tier-1 SOC Analyst capable of monitoring and responding to modern cyber threats in real-world environments.
